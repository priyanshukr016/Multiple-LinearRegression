# Multiple-LinearRegression
This project is a simple implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using Python to predict outcomes based on multiple input features. It uses popular data science libraries such as Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn for building and training the regression model. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and making predictions with new user inputs. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand how multiple variables influence a target value.
